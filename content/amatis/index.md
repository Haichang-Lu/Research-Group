Automated Magnetism Analysis via Tensorial Interacting Spins ( _AMATIS_ ) is a structure to magnetism tool to predict the thermal equilibrium properties of magnets, developed by Haichang Lu (卢海昌) of Beihang University. It is written in c++ and needs to compile with the Eigen package. Currently, it is interfaced with the _ab initio_ code VASP, but we are working on it to be compatible with any package that supports total energy calculations considering spin-orbit coupling. 

The source code, the user manual and the tutorial can be found in GitHub:  https://github.com/Haichang-Lu/AMATIS

Anyone using the code for calculation and publication should cite the relevant paper:
